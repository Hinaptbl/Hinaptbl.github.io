<p>  ~What I love~ </p>
<img src="dog3.jpg" width="300" height="300"/><br><br>
I love animals. Especially I love my dog. <br>
His name is "puppy" and he is a miniature poodle. <br>
His fluffy comfy white hair always relaxes me and <br>
since he thinks that he is a human too, he always <br>
comes and comfors me when I'm crying :) <br>
This year, he became 15 years old which is about <br>
76 years old in human age so we call him a little  <br>
grandpa. I hope he lives longer than I will <br>
because I literary can't live without him. haha<br><br><br>

I also love travelling. <br>
Travelling is a breaktime of my life. <br>
We all sometimes need to escape from a stressfull<br>
taugh life and see beautiful places to refresh our <br>
rotten mind. AND forget about piles of assignments.<br>
This year, I visited Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, <br>
Cambodia and Laos as a backpacker. <br>
It was a fantastic experience and I really <br>
recommend you to travel and see abroad while <br>
we're students. <br><br>

<p> ~What I do~ </p>

【中室牧子研究会】<br>
At my university, I'm studying <br>
"Economics of Education" in a research group called<br>
 "Nakamuro kenkyukai". It's a combination of <br>
 educationa and economics and I have my own study <br>
 topic in each semester. This semester, I chose to <br>
 research about the influence on QOL and SDQ from <br>
 extending the days of school. <br><br><br>

【霞会 経済理論勉強会】<br>
 I'm joining Economic theory society at my university.<br>
 I go to the Hiyoshi campas twice in a week, and <br>
 study economic theory with my friends.<br>
 It may sounds bornig for most of the people and <br>
 in fact, my friends always ask me why do I study <br>
 all the time. But here's my question,  <br>
 Didn't you come to uni to study???? <br><br><br>

 【湘南DVサポートセンター】<br>
 Outside of the university, I do volunteerwork <br>
 at "Shonann DV support center". There, we <br>
 work to prevent bullying to happen at school <br>
 and I work there as an assistant called <br>
 "youth leader". I've been helping this <br>
 work since 2017 and I hosted an event <br>
 this year. This is one of my favorite things <br>
 to do in my university life and I'm really <br>
 hoping many other uni students to join us :) <br><br><br><br>
